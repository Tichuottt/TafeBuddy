      TafeBuddy is my uni's project worked with a team ~20 other students. The app's goal is to replace the uni's website, pack in a single mobile app with all functionalities from website and lots of new features like Notification, Scan QR code,.. With a friendly UI and simple design, TafeBuddy is believed to give students a better experiences at tracking time table, catch up with the latest news, and never miss your plan and classes with Notification feature.
